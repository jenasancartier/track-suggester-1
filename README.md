### Description
__*Final Project for Epicodus Intro to Programming Week 2*__
A Track Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery) that asks students a series of questions about themselves and provides a track suggestion based on their answers. You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant:
* Include a minimum of 5 survey questions.
* Offer a minimum of 3 different track suggestions (you are not required to include every track, see note below).
* Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in tone.
* All previous standards (last review's objectives) are in place (see below).
  * Code has proper indentation and spacing.
  * Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦".
  * Project README that includes:
    * author name
    * program name
    * description
    * copyright and license information
* Site uses branching to return the result.
* jQuery is used to show and hide the result after questions are answered and submitted.
* Form gathers input from the user.
* Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.
* Web page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
* The project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
* You are able to discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology.
